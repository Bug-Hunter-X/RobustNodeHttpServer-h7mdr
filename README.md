# Unhandled Random Errors in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: inadequate error handling, specifically in the context of unexpected errors during request processing.  The server simulates a random error, but the error handling is incomplete, resulting in a poor user experience and difficulty in debugging.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a Node.js HTTP server that intentionally throws a random error. The error handling is insufficient, neglecting to send a proper error response to the client. This leaves the client unaware of the server-side issue, resulting in a frustrating user experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows an improved approach to error handling.  It includes a more robust `try...catch` block, sending appropriate error responses with detailed error messages to the client, enhancing debugging capabilities and user experience.
